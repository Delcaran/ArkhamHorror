            You are attacked by a shadowy being, but a large man leaps out of the darkness and drives it off. He introduces himself as Tom &quot;Mountain&quot; Murphy. Make a Luck (-2) check, or discard a Whiskey card to pass it automatically. If you pass, he joins your investigation. Take his Ally card if its&quot;s avalable, otherwise he gives you something to protect yourself with. Search the Common Item deck and take the first Weapon you find. If you fail, Nothing happens.
