            Cooter Falwell latches onto you and rambles on about his spiritual beliefs. Make a Lore (-1) check. If you pass, then somewhere in Cooter&quot;s words you find a clue to the Mythos threat. Gain 1 Clue token, but lose 1 Sanity. if you fail, move to the street while you listen to Cooter ramble on about pure nonsense.

            You try talking to the elderly locals gathered around the potbellied stove playing checkers, but you gain nothing but stares and a few befuddled grunts for your trouble. Apparently they do not like outsiders. No encounter.
