            You see an interesting book sitting open on Miriam Beecher&quot;s desk. Pass a Lore(-1) check or you peer closely at its pages only to realize too late that the book is Cursed...and now, so are you.

            Make a Luck (-1) check. If you pass, you realize that Dr. Mortimore is sneaking up behind you with a hypodermic needle filled with a phosphorescent gel. You avoid his experiment and subdue the mad doctor. The city awards you $3 and you gain 2 Sanity in the process. If you fail, lose 2 Sanity, then you are dumped in the street.
