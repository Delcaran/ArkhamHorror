            You have stumbled onto a still owned by the Sheldon Gang. Make a Sneak (-1) check. If you pass, skulk away without being seen. If you fail, lose 2 Stamina as the Sheldon Gang works you over while escorting you from the woods. In either case move to the street.

            The corpse you are examining isn&quot;t quite dead yet. It reaches out and grabs you by the throat. Lose 1 Sanity. Then, you must fight the corpse. If you pass a Combat(-1) check, you defeat it and gain 1 Clue token. Otherwise, move to the street
