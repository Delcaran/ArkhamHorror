            The Doctor escorts you behind a curtain where the body of some other unfortunate investigator has been laid. The corpse has been torn to shreds. Pass a Will (-1) check or loose 1 Sanity. If you pass, you may also search the body and find a helpful item. Draw 1 Unique Item. If you fail, you run away screaming. Move to the street.
