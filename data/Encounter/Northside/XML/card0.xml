            As you wander into the back of the shop, you hear a noise. Pass a Speed (-1) check or you look up just in time to see a descending club. Everything goes black. When you awaken, you are somewhere else. Draw a mythos card and move to the gate location shown on it, then immediately have an encounter there.

            A stranger in a turban steps off the Boston local train with a crazed look on his face. Make a Luck (-1) check. If you pass, the man pulls a strange object from beneath his cloak and gives it to you. Draw 1 Unique Item. If you fail, he pulls a poisoned blade out of his cloak and stabs you. Roll a die and lose that much Stamina
