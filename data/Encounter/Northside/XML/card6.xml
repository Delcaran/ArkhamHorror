            A pulsing void gapes behind a bookshelf, sending out waves of heat. Pass a Fight (-1) check or it sucks you in, hurling you into the Abyss. Have one encounter there, then immediately return.

            A well-dressed man is standing on the platform. He turns and greets you by name. Although he seems oddly familiar, you don&quot;t remember ever meeting him before. Then he steps off the platform into the path of a speeding train. Make a Speed (-2) check. IF you pass, he vanishes as you leap right through him. On the ground, you find yourself clutching a scrap of paper. Gain 1 Spell. If you fail, he is obliterated before your eyes. Roll a die and lose that much Sanity.
