            You find some strange medicine labeled &quot;Dream Enhancers&quot; in a dusty cabinet.  If you choose to take it, make a Lore(-1) check.  If you pass, your visions show you how to perform a ritual.  Draw 1 Spell.  Otherwise, nothing happens.

            You find a penny with a strange sigl carved into it. Amused, you flip it in the air, then gasp as you feel a sudden gathering of magical forces around you. Make  Luck(-2) check.  If you pass, the penny comes up heads.  You are Blessed.  If you fail, it comes up tails.  You are Cursed.
