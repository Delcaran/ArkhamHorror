            You attend a ceremony in which the order opens a gate and a monster bursts out of it before the gate closes once more.  A monster appears!

            &quot;Care to join the Order?&quot; Carl Sanford and several of his henchmen ask.  If you accept, pay $3 and take a Silver Twilight Membership.  If you decline, pass a Will (-1) check or lose 3 Stamina as the henchmen assist you out the door.  Wheather you pass or not, move to the street.
