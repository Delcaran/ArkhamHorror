            Carl Sanford draws you into the study to talk and you feel the cold creep of dread listening to him.  Make a Lore (-1) check.  If you pass, your willpower stands up to the test of the ancient wizard and you even learn something of value.  Gain 3 Clue tokens. If you fail, his hypnotic tones lull you into a trance.  The conversation seems short, but when you leave the study, much time has passed and your thoughts are confused.  Lose all of your Clue tokens and move to the street.
