            You are overcome by the echoing chants of the long-gone witches who have lived and died here - you pass out.  Make a Will (-2) check.  If you pass, you learn an ancient spell in your dreams.  Draw 1 Spell.  If you fail, you are missing half your items when you wake up.  Discard half of your items (your choice, round down).

            You&quot;re invited to take part in a Gating ceremony.  If you agree, spend 2 Clue tokens and 1 Sanity to make a Lore (-2) check.  If you pass, close one gate of your choice.  If you fail, nothing happens.

            Make a Sneak (-2) check.  If you pass, you slip into the temple area of the lodge and find 2 items of interest.  Roll a die for each item. On a success, draw a Unique Item, otherwise draw a Common Item.
