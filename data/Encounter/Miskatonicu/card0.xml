            You find a student pounding on a strange device that he has hooked up to massive machinery.  He states that it is a dimensional beam machine. If you offer to help him, make a Lore (-2) check.  If you pass, beams shoots out in all directions, disrupting the gates open throughout the board.  Roll a die for each open gate one at a time.  On a success the gate is closed.  However, you may not take it as a trophy, but instead return it to the pile of gate markers.  If you fail, the machinery overheats and explodes.  Roll a die and lose that much Stamina, then move to St. Mary&quot;s Hospital.
