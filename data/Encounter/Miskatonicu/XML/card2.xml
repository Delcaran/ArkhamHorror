            You find a muscular, bored-looking man who challenges you to an arm wrestling match. Lose 2 Stamina if you accept. If this does not knock you unconcious, Sir William Brinton laughs and slaps your shoulder, offering to join your investigation. Take his Ally card. If it is not available, gain $5 instead.
