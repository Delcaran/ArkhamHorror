            If you succeed at a Luck (-1) check, then Deputy Dingby absentmindedly leaves you holding his gun.  You may search the Common Item deck for a .45 Revolver card and take it.

            Joey &quot;The Rat&quot; Vigil slips into an empty chair at your table and whispers &quot;Pssssst!  Wanna buy something?&quot;  Look at the top 3 cards of the Common Item deck.  You may purchase any or all of them for $1 above list price. &quot;Hey I&quot;ve got overhead!&quot; the Rat explains

            You spot a rat leaving the kitchen.  Pass a Will (-2) check to convince Velma to bribe you $5 not to tell anyone.
