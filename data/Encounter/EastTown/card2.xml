            One of the men in the holding cells tries to intimidate you with stories about the things that he&quot;s seen.  Make a Will (-1) check.  If you pass, gain 1 Clue Token.  If you fail, move to the street and lose 1 Sanity as the man laughs at your retreating back.

            &quot;So, what&quot;s your story, friend?&quot;  A smiling man inquires about your adventures over a glass of gin.  You tell him your story.  If you spend 3 clue tokens, he introduces himself as Ryan Dean and asks to join you.  Take his Ally card.  If it&quot;s not available, he gives you some useful items instead.  Draw 2 Common Items.
