            You find some money on the floor under the back booth.  If you take it, make a Sneak (-1) check.  If you pass, roll a die and gain that much money.  if you fail, Velma sees you pick up the money.  She comes over and swipes it out of your hands screaming, &quot;Stealing my tips!&quot; so loudly that you feel the diner.  Move to the street.
