            Prohibition failed to influence the proprietor of Hibb&quot;s.  You drink heavily while quizzing the locals about the strange going-ons in Arkham.  Make a Will (-1) check.  If you pass, you hold your liquor and learn something. Gain two clue tokens.  If you fail, you pass out.  Move to the street and either have one item (your choice) stolen or all of your money stolen.
