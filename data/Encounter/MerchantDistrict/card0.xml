            In a dusty and decaying roll-top desk, you find a mysterious manuscript. If you read it, make a Lore (-1) check. If you pass, draw one Spell. If you fail, the manuscript is nothing but the insane babbling of a previous renter. Stay here next turn reading it, but gain 2 Clue tokens.

            You open some crates on the dock. Inside you find some useful things. Draw 2 Common Items. Next, make a Luck (-1) check. If you pass, you get away without being seen. If you fail, you are arrested and taken to the police station.

            You come across a man examining some old bones. Pass a Sneak (-1) check to get close enough to see what he&quot;s doing. He finally notices you and is impressed with your skills, introducing himself as John Legrasse. Take his Ally card if it&quot;s available, otherwise he shares a meal with you. Restore your Sanity and Stamina to their maximum values.
