Converting JSON to XML

The jsontoxml.py program will convert a json file to an xml file. you should call getXmlFromDict(), passing in the path to the json file, the path to the xml file that you want to create, and a string representing what the head xml node should be called (For example, if you're doing Ancient One's, then pass in 'AncientOne')

There are several problems that you will find in the JSON files that will keep the python program from interpreting it correctly. 
   -Change all single quotes to double quotes, except those inside quoted strings
   -change all double and single quotes inside quoted strings from " or ' to \" and \'
   -make sure that comma separated lists do not have a comma after the last item
   -Remove all comments (denoted by #)
   -You also might find general formatting errors that do not follow the rules on json.org
