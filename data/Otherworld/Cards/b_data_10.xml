            The creature&quot;s grip is like steel! Pass a Fight (-2) check to break free and escape. If you fail, the creature&quot;s grip tightens with a sickening pop. You are lost in time and space.

            The feeble glow and warmth of the candle is enough to resore you a bit. Gain 1 Stamina.

            You&quot;ve completed you task, but now you must escape before the portal closes! Pass a Speed (-2) check to return to Arkham. If you fail, you are lost in time and space. In either event, you automatically close the gate that you entered through.
