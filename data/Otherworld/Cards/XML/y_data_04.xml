            In a flash of insight, you realize the purpose of the bladed artifact. Shivering, you put it back where you found it. Lose 1 Sanity but gain 1 Clue token.

            The stink of this place is unbearable. Pass a Will(-1) check or lose 1 Stamina, 1 Sanity, and your lunch.

            Time and space bend around you. Make a Luck(-1) check. If you pass, return to Arkham. If you fail, stay here next turn.
