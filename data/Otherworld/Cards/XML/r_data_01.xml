            While wandering the phosphorescent woods, you are surrounded by hungry zoogs! Make a Luck (-2) check. If you pass, they take a liking to you and give you a gourd of moon-tree wine. Gain 1 Sanity and 1 Clue token. If you fail, the zoogs close in around you, their teeth gleaming. You are lost in time and space.
