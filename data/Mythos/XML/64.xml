         Speed checks in Arkham are made at a -1 penalty, and players receive 1 less movement point during the Movement Phase. Sneak checks in Arkham are made at a +1 bonus. Return any Fire Vampires in play to the cup. If a Fire Vampire enters play, return it to the cup and draw a different monster.
