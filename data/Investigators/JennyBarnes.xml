      <story>
         Several months ago, Jenny was visiting Paris when she received a letter from her sister, Isabelle. In it, Isabelle rambled incoherently, writing about men in dark cloaks following her wherever she went, and of hoofprints in the woods, left by an enormous goat. The outside of the envelope was partially stained with blood, and it was mailed from Arkham. That was the last letter from Isabelle she received. Jenny has since returned to the States, coming to Arkham to find her missing sister. Stepping off the train from Boston into the dark autumn night, she believes that her sister was abducted by a strange cult, and is determined to find her and thwart the plans of those that took her...even if she has to save all of Arkham in the process.
