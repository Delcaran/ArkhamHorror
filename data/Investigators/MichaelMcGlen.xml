         As a soldier in the O&quot;Bannion gang, Michael didn&quot;t really believe in all this voodoo mumbo jumbo around town. Or at least, he didn&quot;t until the night of the Foreman job, when he saw Fast Louie Farrell pulled screaming into the river by a scaly green creature. As they say, seeing is believing and Michael is starting to believe. Now, he has gathered his belongings together in the room that he rents at Ma&quot;s Boarding House. Louie was a friend of his, and he won&quot;t rest until he finds out what&quot;s happening in this town and avenges his buddy.
